# Computes the BayesFactor(H1 vs H0) with the H1 defined as a t distribution and the likelihood
# defined as a t distribution.
# It also plots the Prior and Posterior (and Likelihood) and adds a pie chart.

  # Create theta (ie parameter)
  # ===========================
  # This array ranges from -10*SDtheory to +10*SDtheory. 
  # Basically, one creates parameter values (theta) around the meantheory
  # This is a grid.
  
  theta <- meantheory - 10 * sdtheory
  incr <- sdtheory / 200
  theta=seq(from = meantheory - 10 * sdtheory, by = incr, length = 4001)
  # The original calculator is not centered on meantheory (because the loop starts with theta + incr)
  # ie, value at position 2001 in loop does not give the meantheory
  # theta[2001]

  # Create dist_theta (ie density of prior model)
  # =============================================
  # The prior is a t distribution characterized by meantheory, sdtheory, and dftheory
  # > mean effect (meantheory)
  # > standard deviation (sdtheory): This is the SEM from the t test in the original study
  # The t test = mean effect / SEM, so SEM = mean effect / t
  # Example: The original study reported mean effect = 12 and t(81) = 2.4
  # Thus, SEM = 12 / 2.4 = 5 
  # > df of t test (dftheory) 
  # Example: If the study reported mean effect = 12 and t(81) = 2.4,
  # meantheory=12, sdtheory=5, and dftheory=84
  # see Dienes & Mclatchie (2017) for examples
  #
  # To generate the prior, for  each level of theta:
  # > compute the t score (which is the standardized difference from the mean effect)
  # > find the corresponding density (height on Y axis, which depends on df)
  dist_theta <- dt(x = (theta-meantheory)/sdtheory, df=dftheory)

  # Is the prior one-tailed or two-tailed?
  # If one-tailed, only effects larger than zero are expected.
  # Accordingly, the density for negative thetas is set to zero.
  if(identical(tail, 1)){
    dist_theta[theta <= 0] = 0
  }
  
  # alternative computation with normalized vectors
  dist_theta_alt = dist_theta/sum(dist_theta)
  
  # Create likelihood
  # For each theta, compute how well it predicts the obtained mean, 
  # given the obtained SEM and the obtained dfs.
  # Note that the distribution is symmetric, it does not matter if one computes
  # meanobtained-theta or theta-meanobtained
  likelihood <- dt((meanobtained-theta)/semobtained, df = dfobtained)
  # alternative computation with normalized vectors
  likelihood_alt = likelihood/sum(likelihood)

  # Multiply prior with likelihood
  # this gives the unstandardized posterior
